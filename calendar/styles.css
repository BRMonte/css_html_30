/*The best way to create a CSS Grid with the structure I proposed is to use subgrid.
Unfortunately, most browsers don't support subgrid yet.
In the meantime, the best way is to create two separate gridsâ€”one for .day-of-week and one for .date-grid.

/* The grid */
.day-of-week,
.date-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(7, 1fr);
}

/* Positioning the first day on a Friday */
.date-grid button:first-child {
  grid-column: 6;
}
